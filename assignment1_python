#library Access System
# Problem Statement: You are tasked with developing 
# a simplified library access system. A base class 
# Member holds the basic member information like name
# and membership ID. A subclass StudentMember allows
# book checkouts and displays the number of books
# currently borrowed. Implement necessary methods 
# to add a book, return a book, and display borrowing 
# status.

class Member:
    def __init__(self,name,membership_id):
        self.name=name
        self.membership_id=membership_id
    
    def details(self):
        print( f"(Name : {self.name} Membership : {self.membership_id}" )

class StudentMember(Member):
    def __init__(self, name, membership_id):
        super().__init__(name, membership_id)
        self.borrowed_books=[]
    
    def add_book(self,book_name):
        self.borrowed_books.append(book_name)
        print(f"{self.borrowed_books} has been added ")

    def return_book(self,book_name):
        if book_name in self.borrowed_books:
            self.borrowed_books.remove(book_name)
            print(f"The book has been returned !")
        else:
            print("The book is not in borrowing list")
    
    def borrowing_details(self):
         print(f"Borrowed Books ({len(self.borrowed_books)}): {', '.join(self.borrowed_books) if self.borrowed_books else 'None'}")

m1 = StudentMember("shreysh","12345")
m1.details()
m1.add_book("Rich Dad poor Dad")
m1.add_book("Bhagwad Gita")
m1.borrowing_details()

# 2. Drone Fleet Management
# Problem Statement: Design a system to manage a fleet of drones.
# A class Device has basic device info. A class Flyer has the
#  method fly() to simulate drone flying.
#  A third class Drone inherits from both Device and Flyer,
#   and includes additional drone-specific actions like 
#   capture_image(). Create an object of Drone and demonstrate
#   all functionalities ensuring no conflict arises between 
#   inherited methods.

class Device:
    def __init__(self,drone_id,drone_name):
        self.drone_id=drone_id
        self.drone_name=drone_name
    
    def details(self):
        print(f"Drone id is {self.drone_id} and name is {self.drone_name}")

class flyer:
    def fly(self):
        print("Drone is flying")

class Drone(Device,flyer):
    def __init__(self, drone_id, drone_name):
        super().__init__(drone_id, drone_name)
        
    def image_captured(self):
        print("Images have been captured by drone ")

d1 = Drone("r1254","agni")
d1.details()
d1.fly()
d1.image_captured()




# 3. Online Learning Platform
# Problem Statement: Build a class hierarchy for an online
#  learning platform. The base class User includes name and email.
#   The subclass Instructor adds subject expertise and a method to
#   upload content. A third class CourseCreator (inherits from 
# Instructor) allows creation of complete courses with modules.
#   Override the display_info() method at each level to reflect 
#   role-specific details.

class User:
    def __init__(self,name,email):
        self.name=name
        self.email=email

    def display_info(self):
        print("Name : ",self.name)
        print("Email : ",self.email)

class Instructor(User):
    def __init__(self, name, email,expertise):
        super().__init__(name, email)
        self.expertise=expertise
    
    def meth_content(self,content):
        print(f"Instructor : {self.name} upload content {content}")

    def display_info(self):
        super().display_info()
        print(f"Expertise  {self.expertise}")

class CourseCreator(Instructor):
    def __init__(self, name, email, expertise):
        super().__init__(name, email, expertise)
        self.courses = {}

    def courses_creator(self,course_name,module):
        self.courses[course_name]=module
        print(f"Courses Offered in {course_name} created with {len(module)}")

    def display_info(self):
        super().display_info()
        print(f"Courses Created: {', '.join(self.courses.keys()) if self.course else 'None'}")
   
    
c1 = CourseCreator("albert","alber124@gmail.com","information Technology")
c1.display_info()
c1.meth_content("informative")
