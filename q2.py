# You're building a simulation of a Smart Home system where different smart devices 
# (like lights, fans, and ACs) can be controlled. Each device should have basic functionalities like turning on,
#  turning off, and showing the device status. However, the internal working (like power consumption logic
#   , cooling intensity, etc.) is hidden from the user.

# Requirements:
# 1) Create an abstract class SmartDevice with:

# a constructor to set the device name.
# an abstract method operate() to simulate device-specific behavior.
# a concrete method show_status() that prints whether the device is ON or OFF.

# 2) Implement the following concrete classes that inherit from SmartDevice:

# SmartLight: Turns on the light and sets brightness level (default 70%).
# SmartFan: Turns on the fan and sets speed (default medium).
# SmartAC: Turns on the AC and sets temperature (default 24째C).

# 3) Use encapsulation:

# All device states (is_on, brightness, speed, temperature) must be private.
# Provide appropriate getter/setter methods to access and modify these values safely.

# 4) Demonstrate the usage:

# Create at least one object of each type.
# Call operate() and show_status() on each.
# Attempt to directly modify private attributes (should not work).
# Use setters to change brightness/speed/temperature and display updated values via getters.

# Evaluation Criteria:

# Proper use of abstract classes and methods.
# Correct implementation of encapsulation using private members and getters/setters.
# Demonstration of polymorphism via the operate() method.
# Attempt to access private variables directly should raise an AttributeError.
